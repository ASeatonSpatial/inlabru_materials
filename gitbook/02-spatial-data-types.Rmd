# Spatial Data Types

What are the types of spatial data. In this chapter we discuss

## Points

Dots like I showed above.  But how did I make that plot in Chapter 1?  Here is an example of including code that is not run:

```{r 02_plot_code_not_run, eval=FALSE}
# Note that each chunk can be given a name, useful for debugging error messages
# eval=FALSE means the code is not run.
ggplot() +
  gg(gorillas$nests) + 
  gg(gorillas$boundary) + 
  coord_equal()

```
