```{r, include=FALSE}
# At the top of each .Rmd file have a preamble chunk to load anything you want to load secretly in the background. e.g.
library(inlabru)
library(ggplot2)
data(gorillas)

# I think we want each .Rmd file to be able to work as a stand-alone file
# so we don't need to compile the whole book or run previous chapters to
# check things are working here.
```


# Introduction

This is an introduction to these notes.

This is about inlabru.  inlabru has data on gorilla nests:

```{r 01_gorillas_plot, echo=FALSE}
# echo=FALSE hides the code but it is still run
ggplot() +
  gg(gorillas$nests) + 
  gg(gorillas$boundary) + 
  coord_equal()
```
